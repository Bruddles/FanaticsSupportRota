# Hack Camp

This is the central repository for our Hack Camp project.

If you're using IntelliJ, it has a built in SVN manager that integrates with GitHub quite well. You can also use Git on it's own, you will just need to push your local repository to the remote one (this one).

If you're using Ubuntu or any Linux OS based on Debian, Git may already be installed, if not, use:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git

If you are on Windows, you can download it from [here.](https://git-scm.com/download/win)


## Basic Git Command Reference
*add* - Adds file/s to the staging area, so that they can be commited.
   
    git add file1.txt file2.txt
    git add *.txt
    git add .    # adds all files in current directory

*commit* - This is actually going to save the *snapshot*. You need to add a commit message. Be as detailed as you can.

    git commit    # Will open up your default text editor so you can write a commit message
    git commit -m "This is a commit message"    # Add the -m argument to add the commit message in the command, so you don't have to open a text editor.

## Will be updated
